This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

File structure example using an atomic design approach for a react / redux / styled components project.

Inspired by [Atomic React](https://github.com/diegohaz/arc).
